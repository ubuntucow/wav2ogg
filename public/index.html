        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>What are WAV files?</h3>
        <p>
          Waveform Audio Files (WAVs) were created by Microsoft and IBM in 1991.
          WAVs are useful because they are uncompressed so they have great audio
          quality. However WAVs have a few disadvantages. Not only is the file
          size quite large compared to other formats, the WAV format is
          proprietary.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are OGG files?</h3>
        <p>
          Ogg Vorbis Files (OGGs) are an open source alternative to WAV files.
          OGGs are much smaller in size whilst still maintaining most of the
          quality. Additionally support for OGG files has become extremely
          common in the past few years. They're very convenient for a variety of
          use cases because of their small file size.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How do I open WAV files?</h3>
        <p>
          Most operating systems have out of the box support for WAV. Simply
          double click a WAV file and it will open up in your default media
          player.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How do I open OGG files?</h3>
        <p>
          OGG files are also supported by nearly every operating system by
          default. Double click on a WAV file to listen to it in your default
          media player.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What does this converter do?</h3>
        <p>
          This converter turns WAV files (Waveform Audio Files) into OGG (Ogg
          Vorbis) files, whilst preserving as much quality as possible. Simply
          upload a file by either using the file upload button or dragging and
          dropping a file into the dropzone. After that click convert. It will
          automatically download your file.
